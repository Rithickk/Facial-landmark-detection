# Project Abstract: Facial Landmark Detection using Deep Learning
The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning-based solution for accurately detecting facial landmarks in real-world images, overcoming challenges such as lighting conditions, head pose, and facial expression. The solution involves training a Resnet 18 neural network on the iBUG 300W large dataset to achieve high accuracy in detecting facial landmarks, outperforming traditional machine learning techniques, and making a valuable contribution to the field of computer vision.

## Scope
The scope of this project is to develop a deep learning-based solution for facial landmark detection and a corresponding graphical user interface (GUI) application to manage and utilize the detected landmarks. The application will be built using the Electron.js framework, allowing it to be easily ported to multiple platforms such as Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Key Features
- Utilize a Resnet 18 neural network trained on the iBUG 300W large dataset to accurately detect facial landmarks in real-world images.
- Develop a user-friendly GUI application for users to input facial images, visualize the detected landmarks, and manage the stored landmark data.
- Enable data management functionality to add, view, and edit facial landmark entries, enabling them to use the detected landmarks for various purposes, such as face recognition or expression analysis.
## Deliverables
- A deep learning-based solution for facial landmark detection, trained on the iBUG 300W large dataset.
- A graphical user interface (GUI) application built using the Electron.js
